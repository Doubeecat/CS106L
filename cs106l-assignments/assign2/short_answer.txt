Marriage Pact

Q1. It is your choice to use either an ordered or unordered set. In a few sentences, what are some of the tradeoffs between the two? Additionally, please give an example (that has not been shown in lecture) of a valid hash function that could be used to hash student names for an unordered set.
A1. Using unordered_set can reduce the time complexity. But using set can easily handle the problem that some of the tables might have the same name(Which is usually an error in data)
We can use the hash function which seen every string as an P-hex number.And we can module it by a large prime which guarentee it won't occur the same value.
For an example,we can have a code in C++:

unsigned long long get_hash(string s){
    //using unsigned long long to automatically module the value by 2 ^ 64.
    unsigned long long val = 0,P = 131;
    size_t n = s.size();
    for (int i = 0;i < n;++i) {
        val = val * 131 + (s[i] - 'a');
    }
    return val;
}

Q2. Note that we are saving pointers to names in the queue, not names themselves. Why might this be desired in this problem? What happens if the original set where the names are stored goes out of scope and the pointers are referenced?
